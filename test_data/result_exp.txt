homo-related columns represent statistics of the best-scoring (second-best-scoring) monomer after compression of homopolymer runs in both the monomer and the target read. 
Reliability is either equal to ? (signifies unreliable alignment which can be caused by a retrotransposon insertion or a poor quality segment of a read) or + (if the alignment is reliable).
